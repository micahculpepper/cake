Festively crouched at the starting line
Reindeer pumping and thumping in time
The red nose flashes, the flags go up
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
\x1b[32;1m
Dasher maneuvers and muscles for rank
Blitzen burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern
\x1b[31;1m
As they speed 'cross the houses, the lights flash red
The kids get up and they get out of bed
The night is empty except for one man
Still driving and striving as fast as he can
\x1b[32;1m
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago Santa Claus left with their stuff
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of children for whom he still burns
\x1b[31;1m
He's going the distance, he's going for speed
To all the homes, all the homes in their time of need
Because he's racing and pacing and saving the day
He's fighting and gliding and riding on his sleigh
He's going the distance
\x1b[32;1m
No cookies, no fruitcake, no eggnog, no wine
He's heartened by something he cannot define
Belly-shaking earthquakes of laughter and joy
Regale them, assail them with monster-truck toys
\x1b[31;1m
In his mind, he's still driving, still making them play
He's hoping in time that their memories will stay
'Cause he's racing and pacing and saving the day
He's fighting and gliding and riding on his sleigh
\x1b[32;1m
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago Santa Claus left with their stuff
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of children for whom he still burns
\x1b[0m""")
